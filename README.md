## v0.06
Publii + Airtable setup testing.

## v0.05
new, somewhat "real" favicon; decided to use Sapper to route pages for now, still too many question marks surrounding PWAs from a SEO standpoint (probably just my lack of knowledge, though). Fingers crossed the eventual migration to Sveltekit is gentler than my attempt to install the unstable pre-alpha build was earlier today.

## v0.04

Added this custom Google Search engine to the backlog* of things to actually add to the site in the future. Is this the worst changelog ever? It's certainly the first, despite it saying v0.04, so I guess I kind of answered my own question.
